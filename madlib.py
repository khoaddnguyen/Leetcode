madlib = (f"I decided to go on a vacation to Australia with {noun1}. We got to the airport {number} hours early. \
When we went through security, I got stopped because I forgot to take {noun2} out of my pocket. \
We got some JERKY {noun3} for the flight and arrived at the gate. Once we boarded the plane, \
I was sitting next to a very {adjective1} man. He spent the entire flight {verb1} \
and talking about his job doing {work1}. Whenever I tried to sleep, he would step around me to \
go to the {noun4}. I was so {adjective2}. Since I couldn't sleep, I decided to {verb2} and {verb3} instead. \
Finally, we arrived in Australia. All in all, the flight was {adjective3}!")
